/* USAGE
** This file is to be used to update the index.php file in each directory of the
** repository.  This is necessary because the index.php file is copied into each 
** directory as it is added by the repository manager.  So, any change to the 
** index.php file itself requires that the new file be propagated into each existing   
** directory of the repository.

** Usually, this file will reside in the db sub-folder and copied into the root folder 
** only when it is to be used.  It should then be deleted so it is not inadvertently 
** used.
