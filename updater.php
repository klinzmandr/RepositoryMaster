<h3>USAGE</h3>
<p>This file is to be used to update the index.php file in each directory of the
repository.  This is necessary because the index.php file is copied into each 
directory as it is added by the repository manager.  So, any change to the 
index.php file itself requires that the new file be propagated into each existing   
directory of the repository.</p>

<p>Usually, this file will reside in the db sub-folder and copied into the root folder 
only when it is to be used.  It should then be deleted so it is not inadvertently 
used.</p>
<h4>Use only once and delete from root directory when done.  Also delete copy of index.php from the db directory.</h4>
