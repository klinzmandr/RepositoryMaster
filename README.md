Document repository management
The repository utility is a generalized, easy to use, tree-oriented document repository utility that offers a secure way to collect and share documentation, photos and videos within a selected user community.

The following are the main sections:

Overview<br>
Navigation<br>
Administration<br>
Security<br>
Archive<br>
Usage Logs<br>
Installation Notes<br>

The utility is designed to allow navigation to and display of documents contained in the repository folders.

It is highly recommended that the files uploaded to the repository be a standard format that most browsers will be able to display directly in the browser. The file types in this category are most normally PDF (for text documents) and jpeg or png for photos. Other types of files can be held in the repository but accessing them might require the user to first download and then open up the file in an external program or app.
